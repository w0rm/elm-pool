{-| Shapes are only needed for creating [compound](Physics-Body#compound) bodies.

If you need a body with a single shape, use the corresponding functions
from the [Physics.Body](Physics-Body) module.

The supported primitive shapes are:

  - [block](#block),
  - [sphere](#sphere),
  - [cylinder](#cylinder).

For the more complex cases use the [unsafeConvex](#unsafeConvex) shape.

Shapes are defined in the body coordinate system.

{-| Create a cylinder shape by specifying the number of subdivisions >= 3.

    cylinder 12 myCylinder -- A cylinder with 12 faces (not counting the top and bottom face)

    cylinder 2 myCylinder -- Too few faces so it has 3 faces instead

Note that itâ€™s more efficient to simulate cylinders with an even number of
faces than an odd number of faces. This is because the collision performance depends
on the number of unique faces that are not parallel with each other (and edges too).

{-| Create a shape from a triangular mesh. This is useful if you want
to import from Blender using [elm-obj-file](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/w0rm/elm-obj-file/latest).

**Note:** this may cause unexpected behavior, unless you make sure that:

  - the mesh is a [convex polyhedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_polytope);
  - the mesh is watertight, consisting of one closed surface;
  - all faces have counterclockwise [winding order](https://cmichel.io/understanding-front-faces-winding-order-and-normals).
