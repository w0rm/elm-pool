# Getting started

`elm-animator` is about taking pieces of your model, turning them into **Timelines** of values, and animate between their states

@docs Timeline, init


# Reading the timeline

You might be wondering, 'How do we get our value "out" of a `Timeline`?'

Well, we can ask the `Timeline` all sorts of questions.

@docs current, previous, upcoming, upcomingWith, arrived, arrivedAt, arrivedAtWith


# Wiring up the animation

Once we have a `Timeline`, we need a way to update it.

That's the job of the `Animator`!

@docs Animator

@docs animator, watching, watchingWith

@docs toSubscription, update

@docs updateTimeline


# Transitioning to a new state

Now that we have a `Timeline` set up, we likely want to set a new **value**.

In order to do that we need to specify both â€”

  - the new state we want to be in
  - a `Duration` for how long this transition should take.

@docs go

@docs Duration, immediately, veryQuickly, quickly, slowly, verySlowly, millis, seconds


# Interruptions and Queueing

In some more **advanced** cases you might want to define a _series_ of states to animate through instead of just going to one directly.

    Animator.interrupt
        [ Animator.wait (Animator.millis 300)

        -- after waiting 300 milliseconds,
        -- start transitioning to a new state, Griffyndor
        -- Take 1 whole second to make the transition
        , Animator.event (Animator.seconds 1) Griffyndor

        -- Once we've arrived at Griffyndor,
        -- immediately start transitioning to Slytherin
        -- and take half a second to make the transition
        , Animator.event (Animator.seconds 0.5) Slytherin
        ]

@docs Step, wait, event

@docs interrupt, queue


# Animating

Finally, animating!

This part of the package is for animating color and number **values** directly.

_However!_ You're probably more interested in animating `CSS` or `Inline` styles.

Those things live in the `Animator.Css`and `Animator.Inline` modules.

Check them out on the side bar ðŸ‘‰

Though you should also check out the ðŸ‘‡ [Transition Personality](#transition-personality) section as well.

@docs color

@docs Movement, at, move, xy, xyz

@docs linear


# Transition personality

While there are some nice defaults baked in, sometimes you might want to adjust how an animation happens.

These adjustments talk about _arriving_ or _leaving_. That's referring to the part of the animation that is arriving to or departing from a certain state.

So, for this code example:

     case state of
        True ->
            Animator.at 0
                |> Animator.leaveLate 0.2

        False ->
           Animator.at 50

If we're at a state of `True` and go to any other state, we're going to leave `True` a little later than the normal time.

**Note** â€” These adjustments all take a `Float` between `0` and `1`. Behind the scenes they will be clamped at those values.

@docs leaveLate, arriveEarly

@docs leaveSmoothly, arriveSmoothly

@docs withWobble


# Resting at a state

We've mostly talked about **transitioning** from one state to another, like moving from `True` to `False`.

But what if we want an animation when we're just **resting** at a state?

An obvious example would be an icon that spins when we're `Loading`.

Well, in that case you can use an `Oscillator`.

    case state of
        Loaded ->
            Animator.at 0

        Loading ->
            -- animate from 0deg to 360deg and
            -- then wrap back around to 0deg
            -- we're using radians here, so 2 * pi == 360deg
            Animator.wrap 0 (2 * pi)
                -- loop every 700ms
                |> Animator.loop (Animator.millis 700)

@docs Oscillator, wave, wrap, zigzag, interpolate

Once we've created an oscillator, we need to specify how long it should take and how many times it should repeat.

@docs loop, once, repeat

@docs shift


# Sprites

Ok! What else could there be?

What about the wonderful world of Sprite animation?

Sprite animation is where we literally have a list of images and flip through them like a flip-book.

Like Mario! In fact we have a [Mario example](https://github.com/mdgriffith/elm-animator/blob/master/examples/Mario.elm)!

Here's an abreviated example of what the code looks like:

    Animator.step model.mario <|
        \(Mario action) ->
            case action of
                Walking ->
                    -- if we're in a `Walking` state,
                    -- then we're cycling through
                    -- the following frames at
                    -- 15 frames per second:
                    --  step1, step2, stand
                    Animator.framesWith
                        { transition =
                            sprite.tail.stand
                        , resting =
                            Animator.cycle
                                (Animator.fps 15)
                                [ sprite.tail.step1
                                , sprite.tail.step2
                                , sprite.tail.stand
                                ]
                        }

                Jumping ->
                    -- show a single frame
                    sprite.tail.jump

                Ducking ->
                    sprite.tail.duck

                Standing ->
                    sprite.tail.stand

{-| A timeline of `state` values.

Behind the scenes this is roughly a list of states and the times that they should occur!

-}
type alias Timeline state =
    Timeline.Timeline state


{-| Create a timeline with an initial `state`.

So, if you previously had a `Bool` in your model:

    type alias Model = { checked : Bool }

    -- created via
    { checked = False }

You could replace that with an `Animator.Timeline Bool`

    type alias Model = { checked : Animator.Timeline Bool }

    -- created via
    { checked = Animator.init False }

init first =
    Timeline.Timeline
        { initial = first
        , now = Time.absolute (Time.millisToPosix 0)

            Timeline.Timetable []

        , queued = Nothing
        , interruption = []
        , running = True
        }
        |> Timeline.update now


{-| Get the current `state` of the timeline.

This value will switch to a new value when a transition begins.

If you had a timeline that went from A to B to C, here's what `current` would be at various points on the timeline.

```ascii
          A---------B---------C
               ^    ^    ^    ^
current:       B    B    C    C
```

**Note** â€” If you want to detect the moment when you arrive at a new state, try using [`arrivedAt`](#arrivedAt)

-}
current : Timeline state -> state
current =
    Timeline.current


{-| Subtley different than [`current`](#current), this will provide the new state as soon as the transition has _finished_.

```ascii
          A---------B---------C
               ^    ^    ^    ^
arrived:       A    B    B    C
```

-}
arrived : Timeline state -> state
arrived =
    Timeline.arrived


{-| Sometimes we want to know when we've arrived at a state so we can trigger some other work.

You can use `arrivedAt` in the `Tick` branch of your update to see if you will arrive at an event on this tick.

    Tick time ->
        if Animator.arrivedAt MyState time model.timeline then
            --...do something special

-}
arrivedAt : state -> Time.Posix -> Timeline state -> Bool
arrivedAt state =
    Timeline.arrivedAt ((==) state)


{-| Again, sometimes you'll want to supply your own equality function!
-}
arrivedAtWith : (state -> Bool) -> Time.Posix -> Timeline state -> Bool
arrivedAtWith =
    Timeline.arrivedAt


{-| Get the previous `state` on this timeline.

As you'll see in the [Loading example](https://github.com/mdgriffith/elm-animator/blob/master/examples/Loading.elm), it means we can use `previous` to refer to data that we've already "deleted" or set to `Nothing`.

How cool!

```ascii
          A---------B---------C
               ^    ^    ^
previous:      A    A    B
```

-}
previous : Timeline state -> state
previous =
    Timeline.previous


{-| Check to see if a `state` is upcoming on a timeline.

**Note** â€” This can be used to ensure a set of states can only be [`queued`](#queue) if they aren't already running.

**Note 2** â€” This only checks if an event is in the _future_, but does not check the value you're currently at. You might need to use [`arrived`](#arrived) as well if you also care about the current state.

-}
upcoming : state -> Timeline state -> Bool
upcoming state =
    Timeline.upcoming ((==) state)


{-| For complicated values it can be computationally expensive to use `==`.

`upcomingWith` allows you to specify your own equality function, so you can be smarter in checking how two value are equal.

-}
upcomingWith : (state -> Bool) -> Timeline state -> Bool
upcomingWith =
    Timeline.upcoming



-- future : Timeline state -> List ( TIme.Posix, state )


{-| Choosing a nice duration can depend on:

  - The size of the thing moving
  - The type of movement
  - The distance it's traveling.

So, start with a nice default and adjust it as you start to understand your specific needs.

**Note** â€” Here's [a very good overview on animation durations and speeds](https://uxdesign.cc/the-ultimate-guide-to-proper-use-of-animation-in-ux-10bd98614fa9).

  - `0` means we leave at the normal time.
  - `0.2` means we'll leave when the transition is at 20%.
  - `1` means we leave at the end of the transition and instantly flip to the new state at that time.

-}
leaveLate : Float -> Movement -> Movement
leaveLate p movement =
    applyOption (\def -> { def | departLate = Interpolate.Specified (clamp 0 1 p) }) movement


{-| We can also arrive early to this state.

  - `0` means we arrive at the normal time.
  - `0.2` means we'll arrive early by 20% of the total duration.
  - `1` means we arrive at the start of the transition. So basically we instantly transition over.

**Weird math note** â€” `arriveEarly` and `leaveLate` will collaborate to figure out how the transition happens. If `arriveEarly` and `leaveLate` sum up to more `1` for a transition, then their sum will be the new maximum. Likely you don't need to worry about this :D.

The intended use for `arriveEarly` and `leaveLate` is for staggering items in a list. In those cases, these values are pretty small `~0.1`.

arriveEarly p movement =

{-| Underneath the hood this library uses [BÃ©zier curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve) to model motion.

Because of this you can adjust the "smoothness" of the curve that's ultimately used.

  - `leaveSmoothly 0` is essentially linear animation.
  - `leaveSmoothly 1` means the animation will start slowly and smoothly begin to accelerate.

Here's a general diagram of what's going on:

**Note** â€” The values in the above diagram are the built in defaults for most movements in `elm-animator`. They come from [`Material Design`](https://material.io/design/motion/speed.html#easing).

**Note 2** â€” An [interactive version of the above diagram](https://ellie-app.com/8s2yjQzQmZda1) is also available.

leaveSmoothly s movement =

{-| We can also smooth out our arrival.

  - `arriveSmoothly 1` means the animation will "ease out" or "arrive slowly".

{-| An `Animator` knows how to read and write all the `Timelines` within your `Model`.

                -- to update that timeline as well

                    { model | checked = newChecked }
                )

Notice you could add any number of timelines to this animator.

**Note** â€” You likely only need one animator for a given project.

{-| If you're creating something like a game, you might want to update your `Timelines` manually instead of using an `Animator`.

This will allow you to do whatever calculations you need while updating each `Timeline`.

**Note** â€” You'll have to take care of subscribing to `Browser.Events.onAnimationFrame`.
