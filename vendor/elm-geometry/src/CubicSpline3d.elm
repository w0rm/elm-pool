{-| A `CubicSpline3d` is a cubic [BÃ©zier curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve)
in 3D defined by a start point, end point and two control points. This module
contains functionality for

  - Constructing splines
  - Evaluating points and derivatives along a spline
  - Scaling, rotating, translating or mirroring a spline
  - Converting a spline between local and global coordinates in different
    reference frames

@docs CubicSpline3d


# Constructors

@docs fromControlPoints, fromEndpoints, on, fromQuadraticSpline


# Properties

@docs startPoint, firstControlPoint, secondControlPoint, thirdControlPoint, fourthControlPoint, endPoint, startDerivative, endDerivative, boundingBox


# Evaluation

@docs pointOn
@docs Nondegenerate, nondegenerate, fromNondegenerate
@docs tangentDirection, sample


# Linear approximation

@docs segments, approximate


# Transformations

These transformations generally behave just like [the ones in the `Point3d`
module](Point3d#transformations).

@docs reverse, scaleAbout, rotateAround, translateBy, translateIn, mirrorAcross, projectOnto


# Unit conversions

@docs at, at_


# Coordinate conversions

@docs relativeTo, placeIn, projectInto


# Subdivision

@docs bisect, splitAt


# Arc length parameterization

@docs ArcLengthParameterized, arcLengthParameterized, arcLength, midpoint

For the following evaluation functions, the given arc length will be clamped to
the arc length of the spline, so the result will always be on the spline.

@docs pointAlong, tangentDirectionAlong, sampleAlong


## Low level

An `ArcLengthParameterized` value is a combination of an
[`ArcLengthParameterization`](Geometry-ArcLengthParameterization) and an
underlying `CubicSpline3d`. If you need to do something fancy, you can extract
these two values separately.

@docs arcLengthParameterization, fromArcLengthParameterized


# Advanced

You are unlikely to need to use these functions directly, but they are useful if
you are writing low-level geometric algorithms.

@docs firstDerivative, secondDerivative, thirdDerivative, maxSecondDerivativeMagnitude, numApproximationSegments
